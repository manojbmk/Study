#Why we use if __name__ == "__main__":

Python files are called modules and they are identified by the .py file extension. 
A module can define functions, classes, and variables.

So when the interpreter runs a module, the __name__ variable will be set as  __main__ if the module 
that is being run is the main program.

But if the code is importing the module from another module, then the __name__  variable will 
be set to that moduleâ€™s name.
